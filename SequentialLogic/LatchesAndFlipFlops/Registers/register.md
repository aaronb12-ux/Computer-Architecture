## N-Bit Register

An **N-bit register** is a bank of **N flip-flops** that share a common **CLK (clock)** input.  
Because they share the same clock, **all bits of the register are updated simultaneously**.

Registers are a **key building block of most sequential circuits**, enabling systems to store and update state in a synchronized manner.
